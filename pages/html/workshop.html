        I have been making guitars since 1991. Maybe my way is the same as others. In childhood, at some point, you
        begin to love music, and then you love it more and more. Then you want to play it yourself. Then, you want to
        remake your guitar because you're the smartest and you know how to do it better. Moreover, my father had a
        desire to do it too, and he bought a jointer, a chisel, an emery and three drills.
        Remaking, remaking ... It's clear that this isn't the end. A school, an institute, a factory move parallel to
        each other and this is quite an ordinary life. But hands are still nervous. There are magazines and rare cool
        guitars everywhere - and your dream becomes stronger.
        You can bother all your friends: someone brought you guitar pegs, someone brought you pickups, someone made a
        bridge, someone else chromed it, and so on. And finally, everything is done. (1992)

        You walk around the city, show your guitar, take pictures, brag and enjoy. And suddenly, unexpected news - the
        guitar is for sale! There is no way back. Education and the native factory doesn't make sense. And you start to
        repair the electric guitars and bass guitars. In 2002, Kibin Guitars officially appeared, and I start working
        professionally as an guitar engineer everyday. My friend Lesha sends me a holy book for all acoustic makers from
        the USA - "Cumpiano & Natelson - Guitarmaking: Tradition and Technology". The nature sometimes plays a cruel
        joke on you, but fools and beginners are lucky.
        In general, the first classical guitar appeared. (2003) When I started making the second guitar, I thought that
        I was the smartest and that I knew everything...
        And, of course, that feeling has never returned. Everything went through blood, sweat and tears. Nobody canceled
        the experience and it is necessary to gain it - study, learn, listen and do.

        In 2005 I bought the building of the workshop, where I work now. In 2011, I was the first from the countries of
        the former Soviet Union, who brought my guitars to the Musikmesse exhibition in Frankfurt. Today I'm the owner
        of a good workshop with machine-tools and wood supply in case if anything happens to India. All the guitars
        coming out of here are only handmade and with a reasonable price. Like this!
